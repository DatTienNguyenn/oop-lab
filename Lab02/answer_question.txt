Q: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

A: Yes, JAVA allow user to have more than 1 constructor method with different parameter list. 
As well as in the DigitalVideosDics.java file, I have 4 constructor with the same name but different in parameter list.
